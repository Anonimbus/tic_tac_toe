# TictacToe

In this project we are about to impliment reinforcement learning using a
neural network to approximate the bestmoves in Tic-Tac-Toe.

However, this project does not explicityly use a standard RL algorithm like Q learning or deep Q networks.
It relies on basic self-play mechanism where the model is trained by repeatedly playing against itself.
